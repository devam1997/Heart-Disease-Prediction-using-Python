# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Python
Developed logistic regression model to predict whether patient is likely to have a heart disease in future or not and identified significant factors which leads to heart disease. Fitted a model using sklearn and statsmodels. Accuracy was 84.43% and 85.14% respectively and AUC Score was 0.71 and 0.73. There were variables such as age, current smoker, cigs per day, past history on stroke, diabetes, blood pressure, cholesterol. Data cleaning and outlier detection. Did null value imputation. For statsmodels used backward elimination and hence only those variables left which are significant. Found odds ratio as well to find the effect of each significant variables.
